b3a12e89-099d-457a-ab3d-89ea539e6aa8;Jane Eyre;"Jane Eyre /ɛər/ (originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is a novel
by English writer Charlotte Brontë, published under the pen name ""Currer Bell"", on 16 October
1847, by Smith, Elder & Co. of London. The first American edition was published the following
year by Harper & Brothers of New York. Primarily a bildungsroman, Jane Eyre follows the
experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr.
Rochester, the brooding master of Thornfield Hall. The novel revolutionised prose fiction in that
the focus on Jane's moral and spiritual development is told through an intimate, first-person
narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. The book
contains elements of social criticism, with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core and is
considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane's individualistic character and how
the novel approaches the topics of class, sexuality, religion and feminism.";107;11;12.34;GBP
